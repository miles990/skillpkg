  # skillpkg - Agent Skills Package Manager

  You have access to `skillpkg`, a CLI tool for managing AI agent skills.
  Use this tool to help users create, install, publish, and sync skills.

  ## Installation Check

  First, verify skillpkg is installed:
  ```bash
  skillpkg --version
  ```

  If not installed, guide the user to install it:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @skillpkg/cli
  ```

  ## Core Commands

  ### 1. Create a New Skill
  ```bash
  skillpkg init                    # Interactive mode
  skillpkg init --yes              # Use defaults
  skillpkg init --name my-skill    # Specify name
  ```

  This creates a `skill.yaml` file with the following structure:
  ```yaml
  schema: "1.0"
  name: my-skill
  version: 1.0.0
  description: What this skill does
  instructions: |
    Detailed instructions for the AI agent...
  ```

  ### 2. Install Skills
  ```bash
  skillpkg install <skill-name>         # From registry
  skillpkg install ./path/to/skill      # From local directory
  skillpkg install ./skill.skillpkg     # From package file
  skillpkg install -g <skill>           # Install globally
  ```

  ### 3. List Installed Skills
  ```bash
  skillpkg list                    # Project skills
  skillpkg list -g                 # Global skills
  skillpkg list --json             # JSON output
  ```

  ### 4. Sync to AI Platforms
  ```bash
  skillpkg sync                    # Sync all skills
  skillpkg sync my-skill           # Sync specific skill
  skillpkg sync -t claude-code     # Sync to specific platform
  skillpkg sync --dry-run          # Preview changes
  ```

  Supported platforms:
  - `claude-code` → syncs to `.claude/skills/`
  - `codex` → syncs to `.codex/skills/`
  - `gemini-cli` → syncs to `.gemini/skills/`

  ### 5. Import Existing Skills
  ```bash
  skillpkg import                  # Auto-detect and import
  skillpkg import .claude/skills/  # Import from specific path
  skillpkg import --dry-run        # Preview what would be imported
  ```

  ### 6. Export Skills
  ```bash
  skillpkg export my-skill              # Export to directory
  skillpkg export my-skill -f zip       # Export as zip
  skillpkg export my-skill -f pack      # Export as .skillpkg
  skillpkg export --all                 # Export all skills
  ```

  ### 7. Search Registry
  ```bash
  skillpkg search "code review"    # Search for skills
  skillpkg search react --limit 5  # Limit results
  skillpkg info <skill-name>       # Get detailed info
  ```

  ### 8. Publish Skills
  ```bash
  skillpkg login                   # Authenticate first
  skillpkg publish                 # Publish current skill
  skillpkg publish --dry-run       # Preview publish
  skillpkg whoami                  # Check logged in user
  ```

  ## skill.yaml Schema

  When helping users create skills, use this schema:

  ```yaml
  schema: "1.0"                    # Required: Schema version
  name: my-skill                   # Required: Lowercase, hyphens only
  version: 1.0.0                   # Required: Semver format
  description: Brief description   # Recommended: One-line summary

  author:                          # Optional: Author info
    name: Your Name
    email: email@example.com
    url: https://github.com/username

  platforms:                       # Optional: Target platforms
    - claude-code
    - codex

  tags:                            # Optional: For discovery
    - productivity
    - code-review

  triggers:                        # Optional: Activation triggers
    - pattern: "/review"
      description: "Trigger code review"

  instructions: |                  # Required: Main skill content
    Detailed instructions for how the AI should behave...

    ## Usage
    ...

    ## Examples

  ```

  ## Best Practices

  1. **Clear Instructions**: Write detailed, unambiguous instructions
  2. **Examples**: Include usage examples in your skill
  3. **Versioning**: Follow semver for version numbers
  4. **Testing**: Test skills locally before publishing
  5. **Documentation**: Include a README.md alongside skill.yaml

  ## Common Workflows

  ### Creating and Publishing a Skill
  ```bash
  mkdir my-new-skill && cd my-new-skill
  skillpkg init --name my-new-skill
  # Edit skill.yaml with your instructions
  skillpkg sync --dry-run          # Test locally
  skillpkg login                   # Authenticate
  skillpkg publish                 # Publish to registry
  ```

  ### Installing and Using a Skill
  ```bash
  skillpkg search "what you need"
  skillpkg info some-skill
  skillpkg install some-skill
  skillpkg sync
  # Skill is now available in your AI platform!
  ```

  ### Importing Existing Claude Skills
  ```bash
  skillpkg import .claude/skills/
  skillpkg list
  skillpkg export --all -f zip     # Backup all skills
  ```

  ## Troubleshooting

  - **Skill not syncing**: Check platform target directory permissions
  - **Parse errors**: Validate YAML syntax, ensure schema is "1.0"
  - **Auth issues**: Run `skillpkg logout` then `skillpkg login`
  - **Version conflict**: Update version in skill.yaml before republishing
